                <p>If any provision of these Terms of Use is held by a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reason, such provision shall be eliminated or limited to the minimum extent such that the remaining provisions of the Terms of Use will continue in full force and effect.</p>
                <h3>Entire Agreement</h3>
                <p>The Terms of Use, our Privacy Policy and terms of conditions for the registration of events constitute the sole and entire agreement between you and the Crypto Emergency with respect to the Websites and supersede all prior and contemporaneous understandings, agreements, representations and warranties, both written and oral, with respect to the Websites.</p>
                <h3>Your Comments and Concerns</h3>
                <p>This Websites is operated by the Crypto Emergency. All other feedback, comments, requests for technical support and other communications relating to the Websites should be directed to: Global@crypto-emergency.com</p>
                <p>Last modified: February 2022</p>
                <h3>Terms and Conditions</h3>
                <p>The following Terms and Conditions (“Terms”) govern the use of the Crypto Emergency Platform open source software platform (“Platform”). Prior to any use of the Platform, the User confirms to understand and expressly agrees to all of the Terms. All capitalized terms in this agreement will be given the same effect and meaning as in the Terms. The Platform will be developed by persons and entities who support the Platform, including both volunteers and developers who are paid by nonprofit entities interested in supporting the Platform.</p>
                <p>The user acknowledges the following serious risks to any use the Platform and expressly agrees to not hold the Crypto Emergency liable should any of the following risks occur:</p>
                <h3>RISK OF REGULATORY ACTIONS IN ONE OR MORE JURISDICTIONS</h3>
                <p>The Platform could be impacted by one or more regulatory inquiries or regulatory actions, which could impede or limit the ability to continue to develop the Platform, or which could impede or limit the ability of a User to use Platform.</p>
                <h3>RISK OF ALTERNATIVE, UNOFFICIAL PLATFORM NETWORKS</h3>
                <p>It is possible that alternative Platform networks could be established, which utilize the same open source source code and open source protocol underlying the Platform. The Platform network may compete with these alternative Platform networks, which could potentially negatively impact the Platform.</p>
                <h3>RISK OF INSUFFICIENT INTEREST IN THE PLATFORM OR DISTRIBUTED APPLICATIONS</h3>
                <p>It is possible that the Platform will not be used by a large number of external businesses, individuals, and other organizations and that there will be limited public interest in the creation and development of distributed applications. Such a lack of interest could impact the development of the Platform and potential uses of the Platform. It cannot predict the success of its own development efforts or the efforts of other third parties.</p>
                <h3>RISK THAT THE PLATFORM, AS DEVELOPED, WILL NOT MEET THE EXPECTATIONS OF USER</h3>
                <p>The User recognizes that the Platform is under development and may undergo significant changes before release. The User acknowledges that any expectations regarding the form and functionality of the Platform held by the User may not be met upon release of the Platform, for any number of reasons including a change in the design and implementation plans and execution of the implementation of the Platform.</p>
                <h3>RISK OF SECURITY WEAKNESSES IN THE PLATFORM CORE INFRASTRUCTURE SOFTWARE</h3>
                <p>The Platform rests on open-source software, and there is a risk that the Crypto Emergency, or other third parties not directly affiliated with the Crypto Emergency, may introduce weaknesses or bugs into the core infrastructural elements of the Platform causing the system to lose data stored in one or more User accounts or other accounts or lose sums of other valued tokens issued on the Platform.</p>
                <h3>RISK OF WEAKNESSES OR EXPLOITABLE BREAKTHROUGHS IN THE FIELD OF CRYPTOGRAPHY</h3>
                <p>Cryptography is an art, not a science. And the state of the art can advance over time. Advances in code cracking, or technical advances such as the development of quantum computers, could present risks to cryptocurrencies and the Platform, which could result in the theft or loss of data. To the extent possible, the Crypto Emergency intends to update the protocol underlying the Platform to account for any advances in cryptography and to incorporate additional security measures, but it cannot predict the future of cryptography or guarantee that any security updates will be made in a timely or successful manner.</p>
                <h3>Acknowledgment, Acceptance of all Risks and Disclaimer of Warranties and Liabilities</h3>
                <p><b>THE USER EXPRESSLY KNOWS AND AGREES THAT THE USER IS USING THE PLATFORM AT THE USER’S SOLE RISK. THE USER REPRESENTS THAT THE USER HAS AN ADEQUATE UNDERSTANDING OF THE RISKS, USAGES AND INTRICACIES OF CRYPTOGRAPHIC TOKENS AND BLOCKCHAIN-BASED OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE, PLATFORM. THE USER ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY ANY APPLICABLE LAW, THE DISCLAIMERS OF LIABILITY CONTAINED HEREIN APPLY TO ANY AND ALL DAMAGES OR INJURY WHATSOEVER CAUSED BY OR RELATED TO RISKS OF, USE OF, OR INABILITY TO USE THE PLATFORM UNDER ANY CAUSE OF ACTION WHATSOEVER OF ANY KIND IN ANY JURISDICTION, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ACTIONS FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY, BREACH OF CONTRACT OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE) AND THAT NEITHER THE Crypto Emergency NOR PLATFORM TEAM SHALL BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, INCLUDING FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, GOODWILL OR DATA. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF CERTAIN WARRANTIES OR THE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY FOR CERTAIN TYPES OF DAMAGES. THEREFORE, SOME OF THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS IN THIS SECTION MAY NOT APPLY TO A USER. IN PARTICULAR, NOTHING IN THESE TERMS SHALL AFFECT THE STATUTORY RIGHTS OF ANY USER OR EXCLUDE INJURY ARISING FROM ANY WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OR FRAUD OF THE Crypto Emergency.</b></p>
